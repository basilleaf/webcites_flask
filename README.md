# webcites

'Webcites' will produce a geographical web of citations for a given published astronomy paper on ADS. It will show the great circles connecting first author and co-author institutions for the given paper and further great cirlces to the author institutions of papers which have cited that paper. The map will probably come from leaflet rather than d3. 

This will be hosted online with guthub pages and will allow you to figure out where a paper has had impact. 

More details to follow.
